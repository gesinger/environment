# environment

My development environment, set up using Vagrant

# Requirements

- Vagrant

# Usage

To replicate my environment, clone this repo into the directory where you keep
your repos (as it will sync the parent directory to /repos on the VM) and bring
up the Vagrant box.

```bash
$ cd /your/rep/dir
$ git clone https://github.com/gesinger/environment.git
$ vagrant up
```
